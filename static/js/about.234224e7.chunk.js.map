I started my journey as an engineer from December 2017. It has been {Math.ceil((new Date() - new Date(\"2017-12-01\")) / 86400000)} days since I started coding professionally.<br/>\n          I made this website to share what I learned through the journey, and also to practice web development.\n        </p>\n        \n        <h3>Careers</h3>\n        <h4>AI/Web Engineer (2017/12 ~ Now)</h4>\n        <p>\n          I handle responsibilities such as development and deployment of AI model using customer's data, project direction, handling customer relationships, and getting contracts through pre-sales activities.\n        </p>\n\n        <h4>Sales, marketing, and seafood buyer at <a href=\"https://foodison.jp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Foodison</a> (2015/4~2017/10)</h4>\n        <p>\n          Joining the company as the 14th employee right after college, I worked as restaurant sales, online marketer, seafood product buyer, and talent agency consultant at the fast-growing startup. The company grew up to about 60 people by the time I left.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          This company works on <a href=\"https://uopochi.jp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Uopochi (魚ポチ)</a>, seafood e-commerce website for restaurants; <a href=\"https://sakanabacca.jp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sakana bacca (サカナバッカ)</a>, modern & casual seafood retail shop; and Food Jinzai Bank, recruitment agency for restaurants and supermarkets.<br/>\n          I worked in all three divisions, of which I was the sole sales member at the start-up phase of the recruitment consultant division that started in January 2017.<br/>\n          But mainly I worked as a seafood product buyer, whose responsibility is to fill the uopochi website with engaging products by getting great deals from the partner fishermen all around Japan and the Tsukiji fish market partner merchants.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In between the main responsibilities, I was also responsible of handling various data analysis on the company SQL database.<br/>\n          That's where I grew interest in coding, where I found myself enjoying writing SQL queries, and getting good at it. I wanted to explore further into tech, so I decided to move my career forward and become a full-time engineer.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3>Tech stack</h3>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Built multiple client web apps professionally with <span className=\"lang\">React</span>.</li>\n            <li>Professional experience on server-side web dev with <span className=\"lang\">python/flask and nodejs</span>.</li>\n            <li>Fluent with <span className=\"lang\">python data-science stack</span> (tensorflow/keras, scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, etc.)</li>\n            <li>Absolutely love <span className=\"lang\">SQL</span>.
