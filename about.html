                <ul>

                    <li>Responsibilities include development and deployment of AI model using customer's data, 
                        project direction, handling customer relationships, and getting contracts through pre-sales activities.</li>

            <li>2015/4~2017/10 Seafood industry startup in Tokyo/Tsukiji Japan.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Sales/marketing at a fast-growing startup that grew from 15ppl to 60ppl while I was here.
                        I started working here right after college.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The company sold seafood products online to restaurants in Tokyo.
                        I mostly were in seafood buyer & sales positions, but did other work as well since the business was growing and there were always positions with people needed.
                        The fast-growing environment taught me many important things about business/work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In between the main responsibilities, I was also responsible of handling various data analysis on the company SQL database.
                        That's where I grew interest in coding, because I found myself doing pretty good job at writing SQL queries.

                        There I met people from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child">OLPC</a> community that impacted the way I look at my life.
                        I learned how engineers and open source projects are changing the world.

        <h3>What does the name mean?</h3>
        <p>When I was around 16 years old, I encountered a band called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eels_(band)">Eels</a>.
            I really liked their songs, especially <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/V2yy141q8HQ">Novocaine For The Soul</a>.
            I merged part of my name from "Kazuya" => "kz" with the top of the song name.
